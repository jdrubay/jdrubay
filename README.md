### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**jdrubay/jdrubay** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a heatmap
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on no concrete projects yet
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with anything really
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about nothing really
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: whistling
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am not always right, but I am never wrong
